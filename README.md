# bleganapp
An app that helps (people of color) find vegan friendly foods. 

Overview: In 1-2 paragraphs, provide an “elevator pitch” for your project. This should be a high-level overview of your idea, in non-technical language. What will your app do? What might users find useful about it? Where did the idea come from?

Features:
User login: Users will be able to create accounts and log in to the application. Each user will have a profile page.
Activity log: Users will be able to see a history of actions previously taken taken. 
Search: Users will be able to search for restaurants liked or shared containing given text.
Create Post: Users will be able to create new posts when logged in. New posts will appear in the user’s profile.

Technologies: What languages and technologies will you use to build your application? For example, for the Blogz application from Unit 2, the technologies would be:
Python
Flask
MySQL
SQLAlchemy
Jinja2 templates
Mapbox
Java

What you’ll have to learn: In the course of building your project, you’ll have to learn something new. Perhaps you want to use data from a public API, or add a bit of JavaScript to make your front-end more interactive. If you can’t name the exact technology or technique that you’ll have to learn, you should still be able to describe a problem that you have identified that you don’t currently know how to solve.
