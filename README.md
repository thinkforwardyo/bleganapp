# Blegan App - App for people of color to find healthy vegan-friendly foods
# Overview
Do you ever find yourself in a new city excited and then realizing that you are unable to find vegan food that represents your culture? Do you ever find yourself in your own city without adequate food options due to your vegan/glutenfree life-style? I have personal experience with not being able to find options for my body and settling for meat, dairy, bread, or poultry. 
Items that I knew were against my beliefs and ideas of what our bodies need to move. 
We believe your body deserves options. I am creating this app to connect people of color to healthy, meatless food options and black ran/owned businesses. This app will also connect black business to vegan enthusiasts throughout the USA and possibly the world.
